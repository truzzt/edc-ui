- Fixed E-Mail in README.MD
- Added API Endpoint to workaround extension that fixes an API problem:
  - Could not start transfer processes with just contract agreement ids when
    asset came from a custom catalog provider.
  - It would need the asset's originator url.
  - Since contract agreements don't contain the asset and catalogs are not
    guaranteed to still contain said asset's details due to policies, a new
    endpoint / extension was required.
- Fixed MDS Logo not working.
